afterimage_afterimagedemo,"Instancing fading sprites that match the player's animation can create powerful effects."
charging_chargingdemo,"Using radial accellation on a particle system can be used for charging effects to build up anticipation."
explosion_explosiondemo,"Creating complex effects is easy using multiple particle systems, timed with an animation player."
fireball_fireballdemo,"Simulate a fireball that emits 2D light with multiple particle systems. Click and hold the left mouse button to charge a firebolt with your staff."
ghosttrail_ghosttraildemo,"Using a viewport and a directional blur post processing effect, we can create a high quality motion blur effect on the background."
laserbeam_laserbeamdemo,"Using multiple, particle systems, Line2D and glow post processing makes for a powerful laser."
lightning_lightningdemo,"Using Line2D with a script to procedurally generate lightning shapes that spread to additional targets."
shockwave_shockwavedemo,"Using a viewport to render a dynamic shockwave mask that distorts the UVs of the screen."
starfield_starfielddemo,"Use particles to create a dynamic background."
trail2d_trail2ddemo,"A dynamic trail can easily be achieved using Line2D."
slash3d_slash3ddemo,"A quad with a custom shader and a particle system makes a simple but effective slash effect."
muzzleflash3d_muzzleflash3ddemo,"Using simple texture cards we can make a complex effect by scaling and rotating in the vertex shader."
vines3d_vines3ddemo,"Using a static mesh of tubes we can manipulate the vertices and discard parts of the mesh with a simple shader for a vine growing effect."
flames3d_flames3ddemo,"With multiple layers of scrolling textures on a particle, you can achieve complicated non repeating patterns with a low number of particles."
fireburst3d_fireburst3ddemo,"Using warping and four texture variations we can create a fluid fire effect that doesn't look repetitive. Great for dragons and flame throwers."
stylizedexplosion3d_stylizedexplosion3ddemo,"While particles and billboard are often used for explosions, another approach that offers great control is a custom mesh."
